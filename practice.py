# We will be working with these commands a lot.  The rest of them are "nice to know", but are unlikely to be used in the course.  However changing directories(the equivalent to double-clicking on a folder in Explorer[Windows] or Finder[iOS]), creating new directories, creating new files, and removing folders/directories & files will occur frequently.

#Practice:
# 1. Open a terminal on your computer.
# 2. Change directories to the desktop using the 'cd' command.
# 3. Create a folder using the 'mkdir' command. 
# 4. Change directories into that folder using the 'cd' command.
# 5. Use the 'pwd' command to list your current location (just type 'pwd' and hit 'enter')
# 6. Create a new file called 'test.py' using the 'touch' command.
# 7. Change directories to the desktop.
# 8. Use the 'rm -rf' command to remove the folder you created for the exercise.

# THAT'S IT!  We look forward to seeing you on Monday and working with you for the next 4 weeks.
