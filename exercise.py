# During breakout rooms and peer programming it is ideal for everyone that we create groups that are not stacked, or OP if you will.  The following questions are to help us prevent that from happening.  

# Rate your technical ability on a scale of 1 - 10

# What other languages have you worked with?

# Do you currently work in a tech field?

# You can submit this information to us at:

#     tpritchard@vetsintech.co
#     dkim@vetsintech.co

# We will not share it.  Once you are done, return to the main page and click on the "practice.py" file.
